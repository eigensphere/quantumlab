# quantumlab
quantum simulator of control operations on qubits

> The respository includes an elementary simulator capable to produce transitions on a single qubit subject to different external conditions. Then, the outcomes are visualized via the Bloch sphere. The engine is based in C++, whereas the user can interact with data by means of Matlab's GUI.
