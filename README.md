# QuantumLab
A simulator of quantum operations on two-level quantum systems

>QL consists of a simple code that emulates the state transition of a single qubit subject to the application of external fields. The code has two dependencies. The engine runs over C while the UI runs over Matlab (Octave). Some data charts are given to serve as examples, but leaving to the user the possibility to use specific data.
